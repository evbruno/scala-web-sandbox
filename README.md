# Scala Web Sandbox

**Messing around with some Scala (micro|web) frameworks.**

This is a project to compare (_[coding](source/), [benchmarking](benchmark/) and [resource requirements](vagrant-chef/)_) a few hand-picked Scala technologies to develop a web application.

_Also works as a post-morten-back-reference-sbt-project._

The brawling:

- MongoDB vs SomethingSql 
- Html template engines
- Web/Micro frameworks: Scalatra vs Spray vs Play
- Sync vs Async (http://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)
